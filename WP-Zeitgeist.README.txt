What is a zeitgeist?

A zeitgeist is a visual representation of search trends. Basically, a zeitgeist
tells you what people are looking for. The most-well known zeitgeist is Google's
and it can be viewable here >> http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist_monthly.html



What does WP-Zeitgeist do, exactly?

WP-Zeitgeist is intended to be displayed as a cloud. 
Inside the cloud are links, the link text (what you see) is the actual 
UNEDITED search engine query that brought a visitor to your site. 
The link portion (the clickthrough link) provides the actual page that was hit as a result of the query.
The bigger the text, the more hits you've gotten from that query.



How do I style the cloud?

Thats up to you. The links are set up so that they use a default of 'class="cloud_x"' where X is a number from 0 to 10.
0 == not a lot of hits. 
10 == lots of hits


So styling can be as simple as this:


.cloud_0 {font-size:1.1em;}
.cloud_1 {font-size:1.2em;}
.cloud_2 {font-size:1.3em;}
.cloud_3 {font-size:1.4em;}
.cloud_4 {font-size:1.5em;}
.cloud_5 {font-size:1.6em;}
.cloud_6 {font-size:1.7em;}
.cloud_7 {font-size:1.8em;}
.cloud_8 {font-size:1.9em;}
.cloud_9 {font-size:2.0em;}
.cloud_10 {font-size:2.1em;}


Can I use WP-Zeitgeist in a WordPress page?

Yes, but you need php-exec or runPHP (plugins for WordPress that allow the use of PHP inside of pages.

Can I use this as a widget?

Yes, there's some widgetize anything plugin, that will work with it.

Can I use this in my sidebar? 

Of course.
